# BasicStatistics
A basic statistics library for simple calculations.

# About
I started learning more about statistics in school and I feel that the best way to see if I understand the material is if I can create methods that would complete the different Statistics formulas. If you see one missing it's probably because I'm still learning about it or haven't been able to create a method for it.
